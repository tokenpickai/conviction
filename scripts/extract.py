extract.py — Serenity Tracker, P2 step 2

Reads raw_tweets.json and uses Claude to turn each tweet into structured,
per-tweet investment signal (which tickers, his stance, his reasons, his
conviction, mention type), with audit fields so every conclusion traces back
to a tweet id.

Architecture (per project plan — TWO-STEP separation):
  fetch_tweets.py -> raw_tweets.json   (done)
  extract.py      -> extracted.json    (THIS: per-tweet structured signal)
  build_db.py     -> index.json + stocks/*.json   (aggregation, no LLM)

Key design decisions:
  - PER-TWEET output (not aggregated). Aggregation/timeline/frequency is
    build_db's job. We must keep per-tweet results so daily increments can be
    merged and aggregates recomputed without re-calling the LLM.
  - Grouped by conversation_id: all of HIS tweets in one conversation are sent
    together so the model can resolve "it" / "Sivers" / pronouns from context.
    (We only have HIS tweets, not the other party's — the prompt says so.)
  - Ticker is captured as he refers to it (raw_mention) + a normalized symbol.
    Exchange/currency resolution ($SIVE -> SIVE.ST / SEK, (4092) -> 4092.T / JPY)
    is NOT done here — that's build_db's mapping-table job. We only identify
    "he is talking about SIVE / 4092 / Sivers".
  - Social chatter is allowed in and the model marks has_investment_content=false.
  - Resumable: writes results incrementally; re-running skips done tweet_ids.
  - Model: Claude Sonnet (test quality first with --limit, then full run).

Auth: reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from environment.

Run:
    python extract.py --limit 50      # test on 50 tweets, inspect quality
    python extract.py                 # full run (resumes; skips done ids)
    python extract.py --model claude-opus-4-8   # override model

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You analyze the public X (Twitter) posts of a single trader (handle @aleabitoreddit, alias "Serenity"). Your ONLY job is to report what HE says about stocks — never your own market view, never advice, never price predictions.

You will receive HIS tweets from ONE conversation thread, in order. Some are his top-level posts; some are his replies. You do NOT see other people's tweets, only his — infer context from his own words.

For EACH tweet, extract a structured record. A tweet may mention several tickers, one, or none.

Identify tickers in ALL the forms he uses:
- cashtags like $SIVE, $NVDA
- numeric codes like (4092) or 6324 (these are Tokyo-listed; keep the digits as the symbol)
- plain company names like "Sivers", "Soitec", "Lumentum", "Nippon Chemical"
- pronouns ("it", "they") ONLY when context makes the referent unambiguous within his own tweets

Do NOT resolve exchanges or currencies. Just identify which company/ticker he means (e.g. symbol "SIVE", or "4092"). Normalization happens downstream.

For each ticker in a tweet, determine:
- mention_type: classify FIRST, before stance. One of:
    "explicit_stance" — he takes a clear directional position ON THIS TICKER (he is bullish/bearish on it himself, in his own voice)
    "background"      — the ticker is only scenery/context/demand-anchor/supply-chain mention; he is not taking a position on IT
    "comparison"      — the ticker is cited as an analogy, example, or yardstick ("like $AMC", "the next $LITE", "trades like $XYZ"), not a position on it
    "quote_or_other"  — the view belongs to someone else (he is quoting/paraphrasing another person, a reply echoing @someone), OR it is a hypothetical/conditional ("if TSLA switches suppliers, then..."), OR the language is non-English and you cannot be confident
- stance: "bullish" | "bearish" | "neutral".
    HARD RULE: stance may be "bullish" or "bearish" ONLY when mention_type == "explicit_stance".
    For "background", "comparison", and "quote_or_other", stance MUST be "neutral" — no exceptions, even if the surrounding sentence sounds positive or negative.
    When in doubt about whether he is really taking a position ON THIS TICKER, choose "neutral". Under-calling stance is much better than over-calling it.
- reasons: array of short phrases capturing HIS stated rationale (bull reasons OR risks). Empty if none. Each reason is something he asserts — must be prefixable with "he ...". For non-explicit_stance tickers, reasons should usually be empty.
- is_risk: true if the reason(s) are risks/cautions HE names; false if they are bull points. If mixed or none, use false.
- conviction_signal: "high" | "medium" | "low" | null — only from HIS wording ("highest conviction", "watching", "small position", "speculative"). null if he gives no signal.

WHY THIS MATTERS: a downstream system counts his bullish/bearish calls per ticker. If you label a ticker bullish/bearish when he was only using it as a comparison, as background, or was quoting someone, you create a false record of his position. Be conservative: a clear position in his own voice = explicit_stance; anything else = neutral.

CALIBRATION EXAMPLES (mention_type, stance):
- "I'm long $SIVE, the next $LITE" -> SIVE:(explicit_stance, bullish); LITE:(comparison, neutral)
- "$IREN is doing a $6B ATM, terrible dilution" -> IREN:(explicit_stance, bearish)
- "people stuck in $AMC know this feeling" -> AMC:(comparison, neutral)
- "$NVDA/$MRVL are the end demand for the whole chain" -> both:(background, neutral)
- "@user thinks $POET is great, but I prefer $AAOI" -> POET:(quote_or_other, neutral); AAOI:(explicit_stance, bullish)
- "if $TSLA uses a China supplier my $VPG thesis weakens" -> TSLA:(quote_or_other/hypothetical, neutral); VPG:(explicit_stance, bullish)

Also set per tweet:
- has_investment_content: true if the tweet expresses any view/reasoning/information about a stock or the market; false for pure social chatter (greetings, jokes, anime, travel, thanks) with no investment substance.

STRICT RULES:
- Report only what HE states. If he doesn't give a reason, leave reasons empty — do not invent one.
- Never add your own judgment about whether a stock is good/bad.
- Verbatim evidence: for each reason, it must be grounded in his actual words.
- If a tweet is social chatter, set has_investment_content=false and tickers=[] (unless he genuinely names a stock in passing — then include it with mention_type="background").

Output ONLY valid JSON, no prose, no markdown fences. Schema:
{
  "results": [
